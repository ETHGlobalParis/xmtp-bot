# Overview
This documentation provides an overview of a Chat Bot script that operates on the XMTP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) to facilitate smart language prompting for searching NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collections. The Chat Bot is designed to return a list of NFTs along with their images and owner addresses, enabling users to reach out over XMTP protocol to NFT owners.

# Features
Smart Language Prompting: The Chat Bot leverages natural language processing to understand user queries related to NFT collections. It can handle different forms of language input and provide relevant responses.

NFT Collection Search: Users can query the Chat Bot about specific NFT collections or search for NFTs based on various criteria, such as collection name, artist, genre, or metadata tags.

List of NFTs: The Chat Bot returns a curated list of NFTs that match the user's search query, along with their corresponding images and owner addresses.

XMTP Protocol: The Chat Bot communicates with users over the XMTP protocol, allowing seamless integration with XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) clients.

# Installation
To start the program, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Install the dependencies:

## Copy code
- npm install

## Build the project:

- npm run build

## Start the Chat Bot:

- npm run bot


# Usage
After starting the Chat Bot, it will listen for incoming messages from users on the XMTP protocol.

Users can interact with the Chat Bot by sending messages using their XMPP clients.

The Chat Bot will process the user's language input, understand the NFT collection search query, and fetch relevant NFT data.

The Chat Bot will then return a list of NFTs that match the search criteria, along with their corresponding images and owner addresses.

Users can reach out to NFT owners over XMTP protocol to inquire about specific NFTs.

# Dependencies
The Chat Bot script relies on the following dependencies:

node-xmpp-client: To handle the XMPP client connections and message exchanges.
natural: For natural language processing and smart language prompting.
nft-library: A custom library for querying NFT collections and data.

# Conclusion
The Chat Bot with XMTP Protocol for smart language prompting on NFT collection search is a powerful tool that enables users to search and discover NFTs in a user-friendly and efficient manner. By leveraging XMTP protocol, it facilitates seamless communication between users and NFT owners, enhancing the overall NFT collection exploration experience. The Chat Bot can be easily integrated into various XMPP clients and applications to provide a comprehensive NFT discovery service.
